# Road-Crash-Analysis

This is python-based project to analyse influential factors causing road crash and to perform predictive analysis of accident severity using classification supervised machine learning. Essentially, the insights drawn could help creating safer environment and less financial loss due to property damage. The data used is a real traffic accidents data collected in South Australia during the year 2021.

# Objective

The objective of this road safety analysis to help analyse the influential factors causing traffic accidents, locate accident hot-spots and perform classification supervised machine learning to predict accident severity. Finally, analysis results and findings are presented using Tableau.

# Data

Road crash and casualties data from 2021 in South Australia collected by Department for Infrastructure and Transport. Merged and cleaned data results in 21,242 cases of traffic accidents.
